# Smart AquaGrid

## Team KURO

Smart AquaGrid is a **LoRa-aided grid irrigation and control system** designed to optimize water usage in precision farming. It reduces water waste by monitoring soil and environmental conditions. A mobile app provides **real-time data and management insights** for better crop management and future planning.

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Traditional irrigation methods lead to:
- ❌ Uneven water distribution
- ❌ Lack of real-time monitoring
- ❌ Absence of soil condition tracking

## ✅ Our Approach

![System Diagram](images/diagram1.png)

✔️ Farmland is divided into multiple grids based on farmers' needs.
✔️ Each grid has **sensors** to monitor key environmental and soil conditions (moisture, nutrients, etc.).
✔️ Data is transmitted via **LoRa** technology to an online server, accessible via a **mobile application**.
✔️ When sensors detect a need for irrigation, the system automatically activates **water flow** in specific grids.
✔️ Prevents **over-irrigation** and **water wastage** while ensuring efficient resource management.
